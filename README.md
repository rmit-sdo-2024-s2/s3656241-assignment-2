## Solution design
The solution uses a combination of Terraform, Ansible, and Docker to deploy the Foo app. For higher availability, the architecture consists of PostgreSQL and EC2 instances for the Foo application, behind an Application Load Balancer. Terraform sets up the underlying AWS infrastructure, while Ansible automates the server configuration and container deployment.

### Infrastructure
Infrastructure Breakdown:

Client:
Represents the end user accessing the Foo web application.
HTTP traffic (Port 80) flows between the Client and the Application Load Balancer (ALB).

Application Load Balancer (ALB):
Distributes incoming traffic evenly across the two EC2 instances running the Foo app.
Ensures high availability and scalability by routing traffic to healthy instances.
Communicates with EC2 instances on Port 80.

EC2 App Instances:
Two EC2 instances, each running the Foo application in a Docker container.
Responsible for processing user requests received from the ALB.
Communicates with the PostgreSQL database for backend operations.

Components:
Foo App in Docker container.
Exposes Port 80 for HTTP traffic.

EC2 Instance-PostgreSQL:
A dedicated EC2 instance running a PostgreSQL database in a Docker container.
Handles all database interactions required by the Foo app.
Port 5432 exposed for internal communication from the EC2 app instances.
Data initialized using snapshot-prod-data.sql.

Terraform + GitHub Actions Workflow:
Automates infrastructure setup and configuration.
Provisions the following resources:
EC2 instances (App + PostgreSQL)
Application Load Balancer (ALB)
Security Groups
S3 Bucket (for state storage)
Deploys and configures Docker containers using Ansible playbooks.

S3 Bucket for State Management:
Stores Terraform state files, ensuring consistent tracking of infrastructure changes.
Helps in state management and versioning for infrastructure deployment.


Infrastructure Architecture Diagram:



#### Key data flows
- User Requests: Forwarded to one of the EC2 instances with the Foo application running on it by the ALB.
- App-to-Database Communication: For backend activities, the Foo application connects with the PostgreSQL instance.


### Deployment process

#### Prerequisites
- AWS account with the required authorisation.
- GitHub repository used to handle workflows for GitHub Actions and the project.
- A pair of SSH keys to get entry to the EC2 instances.

#### Description of the GitHub Actions workflow
The procedure for GitHub Actions automates:

- Terraform provisioning for the S3 bucket, ALB, and EC2 instances.
- To install Docker, pull the Foo application and PostgreSQL images, and launch the containers, use an Ansible playbook.


#### Backup process: deploying from a shell script
For manual deployment, the deploy.sh script offers a backup procedure:

- Installs Terraform on the infrastructure.
- Ansible is used to configure the instances.
- Confirms the operation of the Docker containers.

#### Validating that the app is working
- Access Load Balancer: The application can be reached by using the DNS name of the ALB (output following deployment).

- Check Containers: Make sure the Foo application and PostgreSQL containers are operating by using docker ps.
